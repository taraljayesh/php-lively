The main description will fit in some kind of live chat support system.
However, there are some big differences and advantages:

  * You can open a chat window (inline or pop-up) to any online visitor.
  * Run on multiple sites: one master centralized site and many clients (domains) to serve.
  * Optimized for high traffic sites.
    * Client sites just need add a small javascript, no php involved.
    * Only open connections when some status change (admin logged, new chat, etc).
    * Chat's script is really fast using filesystem for writing.
    * Idem for reading, just show file contents via ajax.
  * Show your online status.
  * Log chat messages.
